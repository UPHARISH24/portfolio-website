      "Design and Development of Virtual Buttons using Unity to Control Home Appliances by integrating Augmented Reality (AR) with the Internet of Things (IoT).  We propose a system utilizing a Wi-Fi-based microcontroller (ESP32) that allows users to interact with virtual buttons on an AR interface to control real-world IoT devices. This approach eliminates the need for traditional remote controls and provides an intuitive user experience. The paper analyzes the system's performance, demonstrating successful control of multiple appliances at distances of up to 10 meters with minimal signal strength degradation.",
